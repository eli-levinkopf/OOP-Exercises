    I.  I used a greedy algorithm approach for solving this problem. That is, in each iteration take the next shortest
        task with the next shortest timeSlot available for it. We saw in Algo that the greedy approach achieves the
        optimal solution.
    II. In the while loop the algorithm do a constant work and the number of loops is min(m,n) where m is the number
        of tasks and n is the number of timeSlots. Time complexity: O(min(m,n)).
