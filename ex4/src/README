Iterator implementation:
I changed the iterable ImageIterableProperty such that it will get the argument addTo that represent the jump
for the next iteration. In case of Iterable<Image> - iteration on images, this size will be the size of the sub
image (the sub-images are square). In case of Iterable<Color> - iteration on pixels, this size will be 1.
I implemented a new class called BreakImage (that implements Image) that represent a sub-image. This class overrides the
method:
- getPixel: return the pixels from the start of the image to the end of the image.
- getWidth: return the width of the image.
- getHeight: return the height of the image.
- equals: return true if image, x, y, width and height are equals.
- hashCode: return the hash code of the image by calculating the hash code with
Objects.hash(image.hashCode(), x, y, width, height).

Files description:
- BrightnessImgCharMatcher: this class has a method called chooseChars that get a set of characters and the number of
  characters per line in the ascii image, calculates the brightness of the characters, splits the image into sub-images
  and returns the 2-D array of characters that represent the original image.
- BreakImage: this class represent a sub-image and I already description this class above.
- Shell: this class has a method called run that manages the all program. Gets input from user and exports the results
  to the output file (html) or to the console (according to the user's choice).

Design:
I used in a generic class for the iterator.
I also created a Facade (Shell) to simplify the interface to the user.
